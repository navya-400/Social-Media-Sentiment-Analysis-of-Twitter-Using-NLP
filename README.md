# Social-Media-Sentiment-Analysis-of-Twitter-Using-NLP
This repository contains an implementation of Sentiment Analysis on Twitter data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The project classifies tweets as positive, negative, or neutral, providing insights into public sentiment on various topics or events. It is designed to analyze trends, monitor brand reputation, or understand audience reactions.
Work flow:
Data Collection:
Fetch tweets using the Twitter API or use a dataset like Sentiment140.
Text Preprocessing:
Remove URLs, mentions, and special characters.
Tokenize and clean text data.
Apply lemmatization or stemming.
Feature Extraction:
Convert text data into numerical form using techniques like TF-IDF, Count Vectorizer, or Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe).
Model Training:
Train classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, or Neural Networks).
Evaluation:
Evaluate the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualization:
Display insights with bar charts, word clouds, and time-series plots.
